    <h1>Qualitative Research Definition</h1>
    <p>
    <p style="color:blue;">Qualitative methodologies are widely recognized as valuable and credible approaches to conducting empirical research in counselor education (Hays & Wood, 2011; Hays, Wood, Dahl, & Kirk-Jenkins, 2016). Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) is a contemporary qualitative approach that is becoming more widely used to explore questions related to counselor training (Dawson & Akhurst, 2015; Dickens, Ebrahim, & Herlihy, 2016; Farmer & Byrd, 2015; Miller & Barrio Minton, 2016; Osborn, West, & Nance, 2017). Grounded in principles of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and idiography, IPA is used by researchers to explore individuals’ meaning making related to certain significant experiences (Pietkiewicz & Smith, 2014). The flexibility embedded throughout the IPA approach bolsters the expansion of phenomena and prioritizes (a) diversity attached to lived experience, (b) freedom to explore context, and (c) relationship to life narratives (Chan & Farmer, 2017; Smith, Flowers, & Larkin, 2009). Its utility operates broadly within the scope of professional counseling’s prioritization of developmental, contextual, and diverse approaches to applications of counseling (Kaplan, Tarvydas, & Gladding, 2014).</p>
